# orbitalutils
This repository contains scripts that are useful for orbital dynamics, written in Python. </a>
The code is a porting from a Matlab code I developed during my MS.c and is currently under testing. Once the code will be tested it will be reorganized in a meanigful manner. I am committed to commenting the code more, in order to make it clearer to whoever would like to use it.
